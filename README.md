# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python
Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical data, we train a model to classify whether a patient is at risk or not.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 14 features such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

Features

Some key features in the dataset include:

Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Male or Female
Chest Pain Type (cp): Different types of chest pain
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
Cholesterol (chol)
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise
Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
Number of Major Vessels (ca)
Thalassemia (thal)

Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting Classifier
